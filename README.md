## Before we begin...

### Set up the backend

1. **Install the dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd .\backend\
   ```

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   <br>

2. **Add your environment variables**

   Create a .env file at the root of **/backend** folder

   ðŸ’¡ You will find in **/backend/.env.sample** all the env variables you need to create. Or, refer to the list below:

   ```pl
   APP_HOST # localhost
   APP_PORT # 9000
   CLIENT_HOST # localhost
   CLIENT_PORT # 5173
   DEV_DB_URI # development mongodb uri
   PROD_DB_URI # production mongodb uri
   NODE_ENV # development or production
   JWT_SECRET # the secret key for the jwt.sign
   JWT_EXPIRATION # time before expiration of the token. format: "1s" for 1 second, "1m" for 1 minute, "1h" for 1 hour, "1d" for 1 day
   SESSION_SECRET # the secret key for the session (for authentication)
   COOKIE_MAX_AGE # time in milliseconds before expiration of the cookie stored in session. e.g.: "3600000" = 1 hour (3.600.000 milliseconds)
   ```

<br>

3. **(Optional) You can add a set of data in database using a script**

   You will find at the root of **/backend** folder a file named **addDataToDatabase.ts** which is a script that, as its name suggests, adds a set of data in database.

   This way, after running this script, everything will be set up and ready for you to test anything it pleases you!

    <br>

   **Run the script**

   If you don't have the package **tsx** installed, you can install it globally by running

   ```bash
   npm install -g tsx
   ```

   then go to **/backend** folder

   ```bash
   cd .\backend\
   ```

   and finally, run the script

   ```bash
   tsx .\addDataToDatabase.ts
   ```

    <br>

   ### User credentials

   ðŸ’¡You will find users credentials to login in **/backend/data/users.json** or in the table below :

   | Email               | Password   | Role  |
   | ------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
   | admin@admin.com     | Admin44!   | admin |
   | johndoe@johndoe.com | Johndoe44! | user  |

    <br>

   ***

   ### Avatars and pictures

   ðŸ’¡You will find in **/backend/src/uploads/mock** a copy of the pictures used for the data in **/data/{foo}.json** if needed.

    <br>

   ***

### Run the backend server

Once the dependencies are installed, the env variables are set, and data are inserted in base (optional), you can start running the server!

ðŸ’¡Make sure you are in **/backend** and run

```bash
npm run dev
```

If everything is fine, you should see these messages in console :

- i18next initialized successfully!
- Connection to database successful!
- Server is running on <strong><u>http://{APP_HOSTNAME}:{APP_PORT}</u></strong>

If so, that means that the server is working fine. You can now set up the frontend app and you'll be ready to go!
