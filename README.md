## Before we begin...

### Set up the backend

1. **Install the dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd .\backend\
   ```

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   <br>

2. **Add your environment variables**

   Create a .env file at the root of **/backend** folder

   ðŸ’¡ You will find in **/backend/.env.sample** all the env variables you need to create. Or, refer to the list below:

   ```pl
   PORT # e.g. 9000
   CLIENT_URL # http://localhost:5173
   DB_URI # mongodb uri
   NODE_ENV # development or production
   UPLOADS_DIR # the directory where the uploads will be stored
   JWT_SECRET # the secret key for the jwt.sign
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET # the secret key for the jwt.sign for the refresh token
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION # expiration of the access token
   REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION # expiration of the refresh token
   COOKIE_MAX_AGE # time in milliseconds before expiration of the cookie. e.g.: "3600000" = 1 hour (3.600.000 milliseconds)
   EMAIL_USER # your gmail address => needed for nodemailer, to receive messages coming from the contact form
   EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD # app password that you can create for the app using this link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords. It is also needed for nodemailer authentication
   ```

<br>

3. **(Optional) You can add a set of data in database using a script**

   You will find at the root of **/backend** folder a file named **addDataToDatabase.ts** which is a script that, as its name suggests, adds a set of data in database.

   This way, after running this script, everything will be set up and ready for you to test anything it pleases you!

    <br>

   **Run the script**

   If you don't have the package **tsx** installed, you can install it globally by running

   ```bash
   npm install -g tsx
   ```

   then go to **/backend** folder

   ```bash
   cd .\backend\
   ```

   and finally, run the script

   ```bash
   tsx .\addDataToDatabase.ts
   ```

    <br>

   ### User credentials

   ðŸ’¡You will find users credentials to login in **/backend/data/users.json** or in the table below :

   | Email               | Password   | Role  |
   | ------------------- | ---------- | ----- |
   | admin@admin.com     | Admin44!   | admin |
   | johndoe@johndoe.com | Johndoe44! | user  |

    <br>

   ### Avatars and pictures

   ðŸ’¡You will find in **/backend/uploads/mock** a copy of the pictures used for the data in **/data/{foo}.json** if needed.

    <br>

   ***

### Run the backend server

Once the dependencies are installed, the env variables are set, and data are inserted in base (optional), you can start running the server!

ðŸ’¡Make sure you are in **/backend** and run

```bash
npm run dev
```

If everything is fine, you should see these messages in console :

- i18next initialized successfully!
- Connection to database successful!
- Server is running on port {PORT}</u></strong>

If so, that means that the server is working fine. You can now set up the frontend app and you'll be ready to go!

   ```

   Create a .env file at the root of **/frontend** folder

   ðŸ’¡ You will find in **/backend/.env.sample** all the env variables you need to create. Or, refer to the list below:

   ```pl
    VITE_API_URL # your backend url
    VITE_API_BLOG_PICTURES_PATH # path to the blog pictures folder
    VITE_API_USERS_AVATARS_PATH # path to the user avatars folder
   ```
